I feel like this is better in theory than in practice, but what I'd do is remove the tab from the soda can. The tab has two holes, and it would be quite rough where it broke off the can. I'd wrap it with a bit of toilet paper to pad it. That hole will attach to a ceiling/wall/finger/stationary thing. I'd cut a tiny slit on the side of the smooth hole, and leave it as is..

Then I'd cut the side (and top) of the can so that the side of the can is essentially a flat sheet. Then I'd turn the sheet into a massive hoop using this technique (http://www.businessballs.com/images/papertricks/cartrick3.jpg). Press everything down to make sure everything is pretty flat. Then insert the hoop into the smooth hole of the soda can tab where we made the slit.

I'm not entirely sure what's in a hairdryer, but I imagine there's a motor attached to some paddles to make the fan in there. I'll take the hairdryer apart, remove the heating element, pad it with toilet paper, and use the fan/motor to turn my pulley system.

In case that didn't make any sense, here's a pretty awful MS Paint drawing of what I was trying to get across.
